## What is Container Orchestration?

Container orchestration is the automated process of managing the lifecycle of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. It involves:

- Provisioning and deployment of containers
- Resource allocation between containers
- Health monitoring of containers and hosts
- Scaling containers up or down based on load
- Load balancing and service discovery
- Rolling updates and rollbacks

## Why Do We Need Orchestration?

As applications grow from a few containers to hundreds or thousands, managing them manually becomes impossible. Orchestration tools provide:

### Automation
- Automated deployment and scaling
- Self-healing capabilities
- Resource optimization

### Declarative Configuration
- Define desired state
- System works to maintain that state
- Configuration as code benefits

### Service Discovery and Load Balancing
- Automatic registration of new containers
- Distribution of network traffic
- Internal DNS management

### Storage Orchestration
- Mounting storage systems
- Persistent volume management
- Data protection and migration

### Secret and Configuration Management
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Environment-specific configuration
- Centralized management

## Key Concepts

- **Desired State**: The configuration that defines how your application should run
- **Reconciliation Loop**: The continuous process that ensures actual state matches desired state
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic replacement of failed containers
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load by adding resources.
